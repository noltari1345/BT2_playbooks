### **Incident Response Playbook: Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications**

#### **1. Identification**

* **Objective:** Detect and verify signs of compromise resulting from exploiting a public-facing application.

**Steps:**

1. **Monitor and Detect Suspicious Activity:**

   * Unusual spikes in HTTP/HTTPS traffic or error rates.
   * Unexplained server performance degradation (high CPU, memory usage).
   * Unusual outbound connections from web servers.
   * New or unexpected files in web directories (indicating web shells or uploads).
   * Error logs showing unexpected HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE).

2. **Log Sources:**

   * **Web Server Logs:**

     * Apache: `access.log`, `error.log`
     * Nginx: `access.log`, `error.log`
     * IIS: `HttpErr.log`, `W3SVCx\exyymmdd.log`
   * **Application Logs:**

     * Logs generated by web applications (e.g., PHP, Node.js).
   * **Network Traffic Logs:**

     * IDS/IPS logs indicating anomalous web traffic.
     * SIEM alerts correlating suspicious web activity.

3. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**

   * Unrecognized files in web directories (e.g., `shell.php`, `cmd.jsp`).
   * Suspicious HTTP requests (e.g., SQL injection payloads, directory traversal).
   * Log entries showing excessive use of HTTP methods (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
   * Outbound connections from web servers to unusual IP addresses.
   * Known exploit patterns (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`, SQL error messages).

4. **Detection Techniques:**

   * **SIEM Correlation Rules:**

     * Detect HTTP POST requests with long encoded strings.
     * Monitor for repeated failed login attempts followed by a successful one.
   * **File Integrity Monitoring:**

     * Detect changes in critical application files or configuration files.
   * **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:**

     * Identify blocked or suspicious traffic, especially around known vulnerabilities.

#### **2. Containment**

* **Objective:** Limit the attackerâ€™s access and isolate compromised systems.

**Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response:**

   * Block malicious IPs at the firewall or WAF.
   * Disable the compromised application or specific vulnerable functionality.
   * Redirect suspicious traffic to a honeypot to observe attacker behavior.

2. **Isolate Affected Servers:**

   * Remove compromised servers from the load balancer pool.
   * Disconnect from the network if necessary to prevent data exfiltration.

3. **Snapshot and Preserve:**

   * Capture memory dumps and system snapshots for forensic analysis.
   * Preserve log files, database backups, and web application files.

4. **Remove Malicious Content:**

   * Identify and delete web shells or backdoor scripts.
   * Quarantine suspicious files and analyze for further IOCs.

#### **3. Eradication**

* **Objective:** Remove malicious code and prevent re-exploitation.

**Steps:**

1. **Patch Vulnerabilities:**

   * Apply security updates and patches to the exploited application.
   * Harden web server configurations to minimize attack vectors.
   * Update any third-party plugins or libraries used by the application.

2. **Secure Credentials:**

   * Change passwords for all users, especially privileged accounts.
   * Revoke any tokens or API keys exposed in the attack.
   * Rotate database credentials and update stored connection strings.

3. **Remove Persistence Mechanisms:**

   * Scan for backdoors, malicious cron jobs, or scheduled tasks.
   * Remove any rogue user accounts or privilege escalations.
   * Validate the integrity of configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess`, `web.config`).

---

#### **4. Recovery**

* **Objective:** Restore normal operations with secure configurations.

**Steps:**

1. **Restore from Clean Backup:**

   * Use known good backups if the integrity of the application is compromised.
   * Re-deploy the application from source control if possible.

2. **Conduct Post-Recovery Tests:**

   * Perform a vulnerability scan to ensure no residual issues remain.
   * Test for functionality after applying security patches.
   * Run penetration tests to validate that the vulnerability is patched.

3. **Monitor for Recurrence:**

   * Deploy enhanced logging for critical application endpoints.
   * Configure WAF to block exploit patterns observed during the incident.
   * Continuously monitor network traffic for signs of renewed exploitation attempts.

---

#### **5. Lessons Learned**

* **Objective:** Document findings and improve security measures.

**Steps:**

1. **Conduct a Post-Incident Review:**

   * Discuss how the vulnerability was introduced (e.g., unpatched software, misconfiguration).
   * Identify gaps in the detection and response processes.
   * Assess the timeline of attack to identify delays in response.

2. **Implement Mitigation Measures:**

   * Deploy automated patch management for web applications.
   * Regularly update third-party libraries and plugins.
   * Conduct periodic code reviews and security testing.

3. **Improve Logging and Monitoring:**

   * Enable detailed logging on critical application components.
   * Configure SIEM rules to detect common web exploit patterns.
   * Implement file integrity monitoring on application directories.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**

   * Train developers on secure coding practices and common web vulnerabilities.
   * Conduct workshops on proper patching and application hardening.
